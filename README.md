# webapp

A web application codebase for a possible subscription service-based version of knest.

## Minimally Viable Components

  does
+ Authentication: only authorized users should be able to use the service
+ Folder upload: allow for folder upload so users don't have to do a photo at a
  time
+ Presentation of processed photos: previews photos that passed the stages

  photos
